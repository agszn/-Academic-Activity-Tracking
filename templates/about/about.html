The languages are Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Konkani, Malayalam, Meitei (Manipuri), Marathi, Nepali, Maithili, Odia, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, English, Bodo, Khasi, Garo, Mizo, French, Hmar, Karbi, Santhali, Bhodi and Purgi.[6][7] New education policy is based on general formula (5+3+3+4). It is based on the student and is not dependent on government jobs for starting their own business. The major change of the student is learning one foreign language and choosing the different stream after 8th class.
